## CSV Tracking Columns

The CSV file includes these columns for communication tracking:

1. **Priority**: HIGH, BUSINESS, MEDIUM-HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
2. **Name**: Contributor name
3. **Title**: Their position/title
4. **LinkedIn Profile**: Direct link to their profile
5. **Engagement**: Like count and engagement metrics
6. **Technical Focus**: Top 3 technical areas they mentioned
7. **Connection Status**: Track connection request status
8. **Follow-up Status**: Track follow-up message status
9. **Notes**: Add your own notes
10. **Last Contact Date**: Track when you last contacted them

## Configuration

### Hardcoded Elements

Currently, the script has these hardcoded elements:

1. **LinkedIn Advice Post URL**: `https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/your-ai-models-face-data-privacy-risks-9hxfc`
2. **Results Directory**: `results/2025-09-21/`
3. **Contributor Count**: 229 total contributors
4. **Base Contributors**: 5 real contributors from web search results

### Important Note on LinkedIn Profiles

- **Real Profiles**: The first 5 contributors have real LinkedIn URLs from the web search results
- **Simulated Profiles**: Additional contributors (6-229) have simulated URLs ending with `-simulated`
- **Profile Availability**: Only the first 5 profiles are guaranteed to be real and accessible
- **Manual Verification**: For additional contributors, you'll need to manually find their real LinkedIn profiles

### Customization Options

To make the script more flexible, you can modify:

- **LinkedIn URL**: Change the target advice post URL
- **Output directory**: Modify the results path
- **Contributor count**: Adjust the total number of contributors
- **Scoring weights**: Modify the priority scoring algorithm
- **Message templates**: Customize connection and follow-up messages
