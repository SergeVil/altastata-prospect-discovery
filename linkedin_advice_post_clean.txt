I only use what is truly necessary, and whenever possible, I anonymize or mask the data to prevent exposure.I also follow the relevant data protection laws, such as Brazil’s LGPD (similar to the GDPR in Europe), making sure everything stays within legal and contractual boundaries. On top of that, I carefully assess where the data is stored and who the providers are to ensure they follow strong security and governance practices.If privacy and integrity can't be guaranteed, then the model simply shouldn't be trained with that data. It's that straightforward.Mohsin N.FollowSalesforce Architect | Ex-Microsoft & Salesforce | 25+ years in IT | 10+ Years in Salesforce | Proven Scalable Solutions, Complex Integrations, Financial Services Cloud, Data Migration, and Enterprise ArchitectureTo protect AI models when working with vendors: vet them thoroughly, lock down contracts, share minimal data, encrypt everything, control access, monitor activity, run audits, and always verify—never blindly trust.Mohsin N.FollowSalesforce Architect | Ex-Microsoft & Salesforce | 25+ years in IT | 10+ Years in Salesforce | Proven Scalable Solutions, Complex Integrations, Financial Services Cloud, Data Migration, and Enterprise ArchitectureIf your AI models rely on third-party tools, APIs, or data pipelines, you're already sharing sensitive context beyond your walls. That opens the door to leaks, misuse, or even unauthorized model retraining.The fix isn’t just tech — it’s mindset. Start with strict vendor vetting, use anonymization where possible, enforce access controls, and always assume exposure is possible. Most importantly, keep your critical data flows in-house when you can.Protecting your model is protecting your IP. Don’t leave the front door open.Rate this articleWe created this article with the help of AI.
